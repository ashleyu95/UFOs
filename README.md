# UFOs

## Overview of Project 
### The purpose of this project is to help Dana to design a website that analysis UFO sightings in-depth. The website will allow users to filter multiple criteria, such as date, city, state, country, and shape, at one time. 

## Results
### Users can search up a certain shape of UFO sightings in a specific country, state, city, and date. For example, if a user want to look for a circular shaped UFO sighting in the Edgartown, Massachusetts, US on January 7th, 2010. What he or she will need to do is to plug in the date, city, state, country, and shape into the filter, the information of this specific sighting will appear. Users could also search for sightings in a certain state, or sightings with specific shapes. 

## Summary
- One of the drawbacks for this webpage is that users have to input certain text to allow the webpage to filter. If the users typed in the wrong text, the filter would not work and nothin will show up. 
- According to the drawback mentioned above, developers can create buttons for the users to choose which filters the data. For example, users might not know to type in "chevron" for these type of shape sightings. Therefore, creating the option to choose "chevron" will accurately output the correct sightings. 
- Another recommendations is to create filter that can rearrange the data according to their duration time in descending or ascending order.
